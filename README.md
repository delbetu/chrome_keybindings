# Chrome Extension

Custom keybindings
Most of them try to mimic vim key behaviour.

# Installation
0. Clone this repo to a folder of your preference.

1. Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page. You can access it by typing `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and pressing Enter.

2. Enable the "Developer mode" toggle switch located at the top right corner of the Extensions page.

3. Click on the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode. This will open a file dialog.

4. In the file dialog, navigate to the folder where you cloned this repo. Select the folder and click "Open".

5. Chrome will load the extension from the selected folder, and it will appear in the list of installed extensions on the Extensions page.

That's it! The Chrome extension from the local folder should now be installed and ready to use in your browser. Remember to keep the "Developer mode" enabled if you want to install extensions from local folders or make changes to them.
